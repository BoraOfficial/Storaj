Swiss based private storage on LAN

This is **THE** safest and the most private way to store your data.<br>
Why? Well simply because **YOU** setup your **OWN** storage unit **YOURSELF** instead of giving your personal data to those **FILTHY** corporations.<br>
Convinced? Well let's get into the setup then!

# Setup

Storaj is made to be user-friendly. So it's very easy to set it up.<br>
Here are the steps:

## Step 1.) Download Storaj
Downloading Storaj is easy. Click on the green Code button to download.
## Step 2.) Download Python
In order for Storaj to work, you need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>.<br>
Download the latest version for the platform of your choice.
## Step 3.) Run Storaj
To make Storaj work, you need to host your own server. You can either use your own computer, buy a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> or use a hosting service. For our purpose, we will use our own computer but it's highly recommended to combine a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://ngrok.com/">Ngrok</a> to both make it secure and available to you anytime, anywhere.

Enough talk, so in order to run Storaj you will need to open up your terminal and type this:
```
python server.py
```

And **BOOM** you're up and running!
